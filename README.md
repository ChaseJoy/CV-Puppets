# CVPuppets

#### *Software Design 2018 Final Project*

## CVPuppets takes visual, skeletal input from a Microsoft Kinect and mimincs that input in a drawing or model. Essentially it creates a visual puppet that a human body controls.

### Getting Started
 The user should first make sure they have access to a Microsoft Kinect for testing.
 
 The user should then install all the necessary packages, found in `requirements.txt` by running the line
 
 `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command line.
 
 For more information on which packages are to be installed (and why), please refer to `requirements.txt`.
 
### Usage
 Run `freenect-glview` to display infrared camera output from the Kinect to make sure it is working.
 
 Run `python3 kinect_test.py` to display an OpenCV interpretation of the infrared output.
 
### License
 This repo is free to use. Go nuts.
