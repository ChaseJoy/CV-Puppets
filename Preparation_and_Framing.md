Background and context

The Kinect uses an infrared tracking system that tracks most of the movements of an individual that is in front of it. It utilizes skeletal tracking in order to follow the motion of the user, and is able to track up to two people at the same time. In comparison, OpenCV recognizes the movement that is in front of the camera, however it interprets everything based on positive and negative space. Positive space is relative and is indicated on the screen as the color white, while anything that is negative space shown as black space
